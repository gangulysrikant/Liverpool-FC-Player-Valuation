# DESCRIPTION

This notebook is based on the 'Football Data from Transfermarkt Football (Soccer) data' on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidcariboo/player-scores), scraped from Transfermarkt website.

The notebook is being created as a fun project to have indepth analyses on Liverpool Football Club  and its players (the team that I support). 

We start with the valuations of the players in the current Liverpool team (just like the owners of the club!). 

Then a thorough evaluation of each player's contribution to the squad is given by Squad's Performance Analysis. To measure a player's effectiveness on the field, the idea of productivity is taken into account, which is determined by adding their goals and assists.

 A clear image of player contributions and prominent players within the team i shown by displaying bar charts that highlight top performers in minutes played, productivity, goals, and assists. In addition to highlighting individual accomplishments, these visualizations assist in informing tactical choices and group tactics.
 

The notebook will be updated regularly with new insights. Stay tuned!
